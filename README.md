Servlet API provides Session management through HttpSession interface. We can get session from HttpServletRequest object using following methods. HttpSession allows us to set objects as attributes that can be retrieved in future requests.

HttpSession getSession() – This method always returns a HttpSession object. It returns the session object attached with the request, if the request has no session attached, then it creates a new session and return it.

HttpSession getSession(boolean flag) – This method returns HttpSession object if request has session else it returns null.
